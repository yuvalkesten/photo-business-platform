# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build, along with context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme direction—brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. Design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Focus Areas:

**Typography**
- Choose beautiful, unique, and interesting fonts
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Use distinctive, characterful font choices
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

**Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents (outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes)

**Motion**
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

**Spatial Composition**
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

**Backgrounds & Visual Details**
- Create atmosphere and depth (not just solid colors)
- Add contextual effects and textures matching the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative forms: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

### What to AVOID:

- Generic AI-generated aesthetics:
  - Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
  - Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
  - Predictable layouts and component patterns
  - Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Key Principles:

- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for context
- No design should be the same—vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision
  - Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations
  - Minimalist/refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful spacing/typography
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well
